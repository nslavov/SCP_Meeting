[The *Nature Methods* white paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-023-01785-3) proposed best practices, quality controls and data-reporting recommendations to assist in the broad adoption of reliable quantitative workflows for single-cell proteomics.

## Recorded discussions
The best practices for single-cell mass spec proteomics have been frequently discussed at the *single-cell proteomics conference*, and some of these discussions are available at a [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHLRxq8iKFsLJey2MshSlUhg1lGAj0dLW).
